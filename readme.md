# verbatimux

is a simple screen that shows what is actually typed in a tmux pane
and never shows on screen. very useful tool for live demos during
meetups, mentoring and trainings.

# documentation

to be written. this software is in a early stage but still
very useful. improvements and feedbacks are really welcome.
